Read me: SI Figure 6.4
Figure 6.4 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_6p4_OptGTFT_Atft is the m file that contains the code that computes computes the average payoff of GTFT interacting with another GTFT player 
and an Atft player interacting with another Atft player. This code makes use of the function EpayGTFTVsGTFT  that computes the 
fitness of a GTFT player vs another GTFT player using monte carlo methods.
