Read me: SI Figure 3.4
Figure 3.4 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_3p4_MinAESS_Tolerant is the m file that contains the code that computes minimum value of a necessary to resist invasion by Tolerant. 
This code makes use of the MatLab function fzero and the function DiffPayAtftTolerant which computes the difference in payoff of an ATFT player against 
another ATFT player and an Tolerant player against an ATFT player.
