Read me: SI Figure 1.1
Figure 1.1 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_1p1_EpayATFTvsATFT_aVariesis the m file that contains the code that computes the payoff of an ATFT player against another ATFT
player as a varies. This code makes use of the  function ExPayAtftvsATFT which computes the expected payoff of an ATFT player against 
another ATFT player.
