Read me: SI Figure 2.1
Figure 2.1 requires four MatLab m files.  
Fig_2p1_MinAESS_L2 is the m file that contains the code that computes the minimum value of the parameter a necessary to resist invasion by L2.  
This code makes use of the MatLab root finding routine fzero and the function DiffPayAtftL2 which computes the payoff difference between ATFT and L2.  
This function calls two other functions ExPayAtftVsAtftFocalBad and ExPayAtftVsAtftPartnerBad which compute the expected payoff of a focal
ATFT player paired with an ATFT partner when the focal is in bad standing and when the partner is in bad standing.
