Read me: SI Figure 6.2
Figure 6.2 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_6p2_AvPayWsls_Atft is the m file that contains the code that computes computes the average payoff of Wsls interacting with another Wsls player 
and an Atft player interacting with another Atft player. This code makes use of the function EpayWSLSVsWSLS and EpayALLDVsWSLS that compute the 
fitness of a Wsls player vs another Wsls player monte carlo methods.
