Read me: SI Figure 6.3
Figure 6.3 requires four MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_6p3_MaxG_GTFT_ESS_AllD is the m file that contains the code that computes computes maximum value of g that allows GTFT to resist invasion
by AllD. This code makes udse of the function DiffPayGTFTVsAllD that computes the difference in payoff of GTFT vs GTFT and AllD vs GTFT using the funcions
EPayGTFTVsGTFT and EPayALLVsGTFT that compute these payoffs.
