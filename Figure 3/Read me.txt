Read me: Figure 3
Figure 3 requires two MatLab m files.  
Fig_3_MinAinvade is the m file that contains the code that computes the minimum value of the parameter a necessary to for ATFT to invade ALLD when rare.
This code makes use of the MatLab root finding routine fzero and the function DiffPayAtftDALLDinvade which computes the payoff difference between ATFT 
and ALLD when ATFT is rare.
