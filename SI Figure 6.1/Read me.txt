Read me: SI Figure 6.1
Figure 6.1 requires four MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_6p1_MaxEWslsESS is the m file that contains the code that computes maximum error rate for Wsls to resist invasion by Alld
This code makes use of the MatLab function fzero and the function DiffPayWslsAlld which computes the difference in payoff of an Wsls player against 
another Wsls player and an Alld player against an Wsls player.  This function uses two functions EpayWSLSVsWSLS and EpayALLDVsWSLS that compute the 
fitness of a Wsls player vs another Wsls player, and the expected fitness of an ALLD player against a Wsls player using monte carlo methods.
