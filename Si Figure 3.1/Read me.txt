Read me: SI Figure 3.1
Figure 3.1 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_3p1_MinAESS_ALLD s the m file that contains the code that computes minimum value of a necessary to resist invasion by ALLD. 
This code makes use of the MatLab function fzero and the function DiffPayAtftAlld which computes the difference in payoff of an ATFT player against 
another ATFT player and an ALLD player against an ATFT player.
