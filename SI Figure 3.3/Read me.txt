Read me: SI Figure 3.3
Figure 3.3 requires two MatLab m files.  
SI_Fig_3p3_MinAESS_ALLc s the m file that contains the code that computes minimum value of a necessary to resist invasion by ALLc. 
This code makes use of the MatLab function fzero and the function DiffPayAtftAllc which computes the difference in payoff of an ATFT player against 
another ATFT player and an ALLc player against an ATFT player.
